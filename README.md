# Cv Project

After

- check out other people versions

NOW

- extract tradsh cans and header stuff

When I revisit

- clean up jsx + css (remove shadow class)
- if enter and empty just ignore
- try to extract components
- add option to auto fill sample data (chat gpt to generate)
- date formatting
- editing experience responsibility -> break if too long
- order things by date
- lifecycle method to match document title with users name
- autofill like the chrome and fireforx one is ugly as shit
